    <h2>Lola’s Main Archetype</h2>
    <div class="text">Lola’s main archetype is a rebel (Outlaw). Like all other people participating in drug dealing, she is against the government and the law, which forbids drug dealing especially for meth and heroin. This means that drug dealers and people participating in such acts would be relatively isolated from the “normal” society, which views drugs as greatly harmful as they disrupt the order of society. That means the people with connections to drugs would have to take risks and would likely be brave, individual, and illegal. This makes Lola especially fit for the rebel archetype. Even more “rebel” than other low-ranked drug participators, such as the “muscle man” and her soldiers, she also has more individuality as she does not want to completely follow Eldridge or the cartel and become a mere pawn of theirs. She wants to create her kingdom, and that makes her even more like a “rebel” as she is progressive and ambitious.</div>
    <br/>

    <h2>Different Archetypal Traits</h2>
    <br/>
    <h3>Independent</h3>
    <div class="text">She not only has to be independent to maintain her prestige in the gang, but also she has to be independent to live.</div>
    <div class="quote">“Food or death. Those are the choices. Her mother taught her that, at least. The knowledge has kept her alive.” Pg 61</div>
    <div class="quote">“She can’t lower herself on bended knee to Eldridge Waterston and present him with a hundred thousand dollars in cash.” Pg 181</div>
    <h3>Potentially (Actually) Criminal</h3>
    <div class="text">To create her prestige and maintain it, she would be cruel and potentially a criminal to do so. This shows the core of a rebel, that they were against the greater society and its rules.</div>
    <div class="quote">“In one quick movement, Lola draws the knife and tries to slice clean through Hector’s trigger finger.” Pg 68</div>
    <h3>Risk Taking</h3>
    <div class="text">Lola has to take risks against the greater power, either the government or Los Liones. She has to take great risks to turn the tide.</div>
    <div class="quote">“They are both wrong, Lola thinks. This city is mine.” Pg 209</div>
    <div class="quote">“Lola strikes flame to alcohol and casts the concoction atop the pile of heroin on the floor. The fire that sparks there shoots up, high as Eldridge is tall. The fat man jumps back, shouting his own curses at the muscleman in Spanish—moron, death, pain, idiot, asshole.” Pg 305</div>
    <h3>Progressive (Potentially Arrogant)</h3>
    <div class="text">Lola has to progress over time so that she can maintain her power. In addition, you have to want to feel your power to be psychologically confident with the business.</div>
    <div class="quote">“Lola feels a surge of fear and then pride that she has finally graduated from middle management.” Pg 86</div>
    <div class="quote">“but that her rebellious baby brother was bragging on her, acknowledging her talent, her leadership.” Pg 226</div>
    <h3>Fearless/Bold</h3>
    <div class="text">Fear is a great setback when fighting against a great power. Boldness is needed to move on.</div>
    <div class="quote">“Andrea notices the change in Lola’s behavior——the eating, the posture, the cursing.” Pg 259</div>
    <br/>


    <h2>Lola’s Nondominant Archetype</h2>
    <div class="text">Lola’s Nondominant Archetype is the archetype of caregiver. This archetype would completely contradict her major archetype, which is the rebel/outlaw. Unlike the rebel archetype, the caregiver would be selfless and loyal and would lack personal ambitions. This caregiver trait of Lola is nondominant, that most of the time Lola is a rebel, but on various occasions, Lola would be a caregiver. Such occasions can be seen in Lola’s relationship with Lucy Amaros. For Lucy, Lola was caregiving in nearly all circumstances, including sometimes taking over her rebel trait and role to save Lucy and trying to protect her all the time, making Lucy a high priority of her actions. However, this caregiver trait may also be seen in her relationship with Hector, her baby brother. She would try to raise her brother like a mother and protect his brother, even killing Carlos when she feels that Hector is being threatened. However, at other times, when Hector did not obey her rebel leader’s role, she would punish Hector with no hesitation. In the story, we can see this trait growing over time, from just giving temporary shelter to living and caring for Lucy. However, this will still be nondominant as she would need to be cruel when participating in drug society.</div>
    <div class="quote">“‘He was stealing from us,’ Lola said” Pg 66</div>
    <div class="quote">“Assault with a deadly weapon. On a police officer. Sentence would have to be life. Or death.” Pg 113</div>
    <div class="quote">“Either way she goes, Lola has decided there is a decent chance she won’t survive the week. That’s why she’s picked out a private kindergarten for Lucy.” Pg 212</div>
    <div class="quote">“Not great, Lola thinks. Dead. Can’t get my kid into kindergarten.” Pg 221</div>
    <div class="quote">“She is surprised to this plan now is letting her living room serve as a makeshift death chamber while a five-year-old sleeps down the hall.” Pg 247</div>
    <div class="quote">“Still, Lola thinks, is this the crowd she wants Lucy running with?” Pg 277</div>
    <div class="quote">“She was his mother when their own mother couldn’t be……” Pg 278</div>
    <div class="quote">“it is not relief Lola feels, but self-hatred for being able to so easily convince Eldridge she would take an innocent life.” Pg 306</div>
    <br/>

    <h2>Conflicts that move the plot</h2>
    <div class="text">One conflict that moved the plot in the relationship with Lola was her conflict with the “smaller society”, which is the leaders of drug dealing in Los Angeles, including Eldridge Waterson and Juan Gomez. This conflict was majorly due to her rebel trait and her ambitions, which motivated her to get more power and control over drug exchanges. Thus, she would try to live on and try to defeat Eldridge and Juan to become the ultimate dealer of Los Angeles. This would move Lola to try to live on, trying to live between Juan and Eldridge, and lastly burn Eldridge’s warehouse and kill Juan. If Lola is not such independent, that she acts more like a pawn but not the player, she would be like Mila, that she was a tool that could be disposed of easily. Trying to live on without losing her power moved the plot.</div>
    <div class="text">Another conflict that moved the plot was Lola’s conflict with Hector. Hector was Lola’s baby brother, and she raised Hector just like her child. She gives care to Hector and tries to protect Hector when she feels Carlos is harming Hector. However, when Hector disobeys Lola’s instructions, first when he gives mercy in the drug deal, and second when he jumps up to fight Darrel King, Lola tries to punish Hector. For the first event, Lola punished Hector by cutting off his trigger finger, and for the second event, Lola punished Hector by sending Hector to jail. This would move the plot as her conflict with Hector forced Lola into some kind of desperation. She was assigned by the cartel to intercept the drug deal between Darrel King and Mr. X, but because of Hector, she fails and is forced to infiltrate Eldridge (Mr. X). Later, when she tries to make a deal with Darrel, who caught Lola’s mom and brother hostage, because of Hector jumping out and assaulting Darrel, she has to kill Darrel King, which pushes her to a spot where both Eldridge and Juan want her to die.</div>
    <div class="text">The third conflict that moved the plot was Lola’s conflict with herself. Her role in the society of Los Angeles was as an outlaw who tried to sell drugs. However, instead of being lawless and ambitious, on some occasions, she was caregiving, especially when she was interacting with Lucy Amaros. This was because she was a human and had human feelings. She wanted a normal life like a middle class but had to participate in drugs. This made her work and role in society conflict with her human feelings. We can see that sometimes Lola would try to give up her interests to protect the people she loved, but most of the time, she would be like a cruel gang leader.</div>
    <br/>

    <h2>Tension or correspondence</h2>
    <div class="text">Dichotomy 1: She is the leader of a gang that sells drugs, but she would not trust or feel pity for any drug addicts, thus hating her customers. Thus, this shows the complexity of Lola, she has relatively high moral standards, but her role in society is to supply the people she dislikes with drugs. If she hated people being drug addicts, she should not participate in drug deals. However, such an act of double standards is reasonable, because people would want money higher than their moral values.</div>
    <div class="text">Dichotomy 2: One tension of the story was that Lola was a rebel but at the same time was a caregiver. This caused a great dichotomy in her actions. She as a leader of a drug gang would have to show cruelty and ambition so that she can gain her prestige and make her drug empire continue to grow. However, this does not mean that she was completely following the actions of drug dealers. Just like everyone, people dealing with drugs are not cold as machines but also human beings. For example, Lola would try to protect Lucy from her family and the drug society. In the plot, her caregiver side and her outlaw side would change to take over her actions, causing great dichotomy in different decisions. Sometimes it would conflict and cause inconvenience in her drug actions.</div>
    <div class="text">Correspondence: One correspondence of the story was that Lola as a woman would do better when interacting with women in a gender-based society. Perhaps due to the Latino society’s structure, women and men had great differences in status. Lola was a woman, so she was not included in the Crenshaw Four at first. This caused some inconvenience. But also, because she was a woman, she dealt with Lucy, Sadie, Mila, and Andrea with ease. This corresponds to the society’s structure it was mostly conservative and would feel that women were greatly different from men in social status, creating some barriers between men and women.</div>
    <br/>

    <h2>Lola’s Evolution Throughout the text based on Society</h2>
    <div class="text">Lola does not seem to have a clear straight-trend development, and it does not seem like she has completely realized something or changed her archetype. She is still an outlaw, at least for her role in society and her decision to create her gang. However, it seems like Lola’s nondominant archetype has somewhat grown through the plot. She turned from a leader in the shadow, perhaps fake-loving Garcia, to someone who now cares about Lucy and her family. She had protected Lucy and sheltered her. She had saved her mother. However, it still seemed that she was cruel on many other occasions just like a gang leader, that she would send her brother to jail, and would kill her boyfriend to control the gang. It seemed that her caregiver side, or humane side did not overtake her rebel side but only became somewhat more of her part. </div>
    <div class="text">This development would have great links to society. Society would not tolerate drug dealers, even though they will still have a great need for drugs, but the majority would not like it. There were laws implemented, and police officers were recruited just to punish such drug dealers. Thus, a smaller society had formed in the dark, which was the drug society. They have to live in the shadows and fight for their portion of the money. If Lola does not give up her drug gang leader status, she will have to deal with drug dealers and users, who will fight to the death for their customers and supply. This means that she needs to remain cruel, fight for prestige, and fight in the system of this drug society, even when her caregiver side tells her to stay with her family and Lucy and to help them live on. She would not become middle-class and peacefully live on until she gave up the drugs.</div>
    <h4>Evidence of her caregiver archetype growing through text</h4>
    <h5>By the Start</h5>
    <div class="quote">“Lola stops these thoughts. There is no point. She is not Lucy’s mother. There is nothing she can do to save this child.” Pg 10</div>

    <h5>By the Middle</h5>
    <div class="quote">“She fingers the switchblade she shouldn’t have been able to sneak into an LAPD precinct but could and did. Her pocket is large, and it swallows her hand like a favorite blanket. The knife’s aluminum handle cools her fiery palm.” Pg 111</div>
    <div class="quote">“Even when they find her, though, she can’t go dying, because then she will have to leave Lucy with Garcia.” Pg 254</div>

    <h5>By the End</h5>
    <div class="quote">“Lola’s own face burns red fire now. She is pissed at the fat man outside and his littering hot muscle, the man Lola can only fantasize is an ally, ready to twist both her and Lucy into painful pretzels before shooting them in the head and dissolving their bones in lye so their loved ones can’t identify them. But who are their loved ones? The Amaros, Lucy’s grandparents, have yet to call to ask after her or their daughter. Garcia will be sorry but relieved. Jorge and Marcos will be late to the killing party. Lucy and Lola, the two of them together in this bathroom, are all they’ve got.
        They have to survive tonight, and then they have to live.” Pg 298
